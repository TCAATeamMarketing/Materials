Write a basic draft for a script.

Here is a basic draft script for an Apple Watch emergency services video ad:

[Fade in on a young woman jogging alone on a quiet trail. She suddenly trips and falls hard, crying out in pain as she clutches her ankle.]

Voiceover: Emergencies can happen anywhere, anytime. But with Apple Watch, help is always within reach.

[The woman struggles to reach her iPhone in her pocket. She taps the side button on her Apple Watch and holds it down.]

Voiceover: With just a few taps, Apple Watch can instantly connect you to emergency services, no matter where you are.

[The watch face shows the call connecting as the woman speaks urgently into it. Fade to a shot of emergency responders rushing to the scene.]

Voiceover: Apple Watch's emergency services feature gives you the confidence to adventure further, knowing you're never alone.

[The woman is helped into an ambulance as she looks at her Apple Watch with relief. Cut to a series of quick shots of the watch's emergency features in action.]

Voiceover: Because when every second counts, Apple Watch is there to keep you safe.

[Logo and tagline appear: "Apple Watch. The future of personal safety."]

Voiceover: Apple Watch. The future of personal safety.

[Fade to black.]

This provides a basic narrative structure highlighting the key benefits of the Apple Watch emergency services feature - its ease of use, global availability, and ability to get help fast in a crisis. The voiceover ties it all together with a reassuring, empowering message.

This is good, but it should be a bit longer.
